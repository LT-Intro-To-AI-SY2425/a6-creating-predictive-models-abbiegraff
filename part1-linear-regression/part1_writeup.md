# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
A larger r^2 value shows a stronger linear regression model as more of the variation can be explained. I believe that 0.79 was the r^2 value for this dataset. 
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person 42 years old is around 137.5. 
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
0.79 is a relatively strong correlation however it's not accurate enough to predict someone's blood pressure based on age due to the fact that blood pressure is very specific to an individual and what their body requires. If the dataset had more data and trials, it would be more useful at giving predicted blood pressures by age.
