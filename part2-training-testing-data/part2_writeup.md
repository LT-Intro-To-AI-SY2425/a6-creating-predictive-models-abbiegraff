# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the model I made in previous lesson because it gives the training data, predictions, AND testing data. Along with this, training data is helpful for telling the accuracy of the model.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The linear relationship with age explains the 62.6% of the variation in blood pressure. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
My model is accurate because based on test results, it was on target with those values. I wouldn't say, however, that it is great for using in real life because there is a larger and larger error (r-value) as age increases, causing inaccuracies within the data. Feeding more data to this model would help increase accuracy.
