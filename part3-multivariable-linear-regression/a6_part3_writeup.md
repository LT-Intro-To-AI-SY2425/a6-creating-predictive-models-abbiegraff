# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The R squared coefficient for the model is 0.86, meaning that there is 86% accuracy. 
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
My model is accurate because the R model is .86 which is the strongest one of all of the models. It's not perfect, but better than most. 
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The model predicts a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth $10,601.26. 20 years with 150000 miles is $2,802.54.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This occurs because most of the data covers younger ages of cars and not enough variations in mileage. This makes the model less useful.
